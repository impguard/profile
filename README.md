# profile

Storing some standard profile settings for a linux-flavored environment.

Typically, running one of the install scripts for the associated environment
should install all the various tools. However, assuming you are running in a
Linux flavored Bash environment, the dot files located in this project are all
you need to set things up.

```
.bashrc         # Configuration for a bash environment
.zshrc          # [DEPRECATED] Configuration for a zsh environment
.screenrc       # Configuration for a screen environment
.vimrc          # Configuration for vim
.gitconfig      # Configuration for git
```

Some useful tools I always find useful include:

- `autojump`
- `shellcheck`
