profile
=======

Storing some standard profile settings for a linux-flavored environment.

Typically, running one of the install scripts for the associated environment
should install all the various tools. However, assuming you are running in a
Linux flavored Bash environment, the dot files located in this project are all
you need to set things up.

```
.bashrc         # Configuration for a bash environment
.screenrc       # Configuration for a screen environment
.vimrc          # Configuration for vim
.gitconfig      # Configuration for git
.zshrc          # [DEPRECATED] Configuration for a zsh environment
```

Code Directory
--------------

I default to a particular code directory structure that I setup in each
environment.

A common `Code` directory in the root directory which stores various Code
projects as well as a shared bin path for useful utilities.

Additional Applications
-----------------------

Some additional tools I find useful included in each environment are:

- `autojump`
- `shellcheck`
- `bake`

Some additional applications I install if possible through automation are:

- `Chrome`
- `Docker`
- `Alfred` for OSX
- `Iterm` for OSX
- `Alfred` for OSX
